# K nearest neighbor for pulsar

Knn have been used to classify pulsars : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321987873_Pulsar_Selection_Using_Fuzzy_knn_Classifier 
There have been attempts to implement knn on quantum chips : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09187.pdf, https://github.com/GroenteLepel/qiskit-quantum-knn, https://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/913395/daniel_kok_4_maart_2021.pdf

Can we do quantum knn for pulsar classification ?
