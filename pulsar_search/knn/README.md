# Machine learning for pulsar detection

Machine learning methods have been used quite heavily to detect pulsars : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01208.pdf
The dataset usually used is HTRU2 : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2 

## K-nearest neighbors :
Knn have been used to classify pulsars : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321987873_Pulsar_Selection_Using_Fuzzy_knn_Classifier 
There have been attempts to implement knn on quantum chips : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09187.pdf, https://github.com/GroenteLepel/qiskit-quantum-knn, https://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/913395/daniel_kok_4_maart_2021.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04253.pdf

Can we do quantum knn for pulsar classification ?
